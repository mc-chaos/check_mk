a check_mk check plugin for running xen vms

this is my dev tree, the master version will be at the check_mk exchange, 
so please have a look there too.

it is not easily possible to trace the status of a vm that was shutdown, 
because it vanishes from xm list and all similar commands.
the right thing[tm] appears to be to not create them using 
xm create /path/to/cfgfile , but using
xm new /path/to/cfgfile (and then one more command to "unpause" it?)

I haven't tested it yet but already had to learn that this functionality is 
broken on the new debian lenny.
